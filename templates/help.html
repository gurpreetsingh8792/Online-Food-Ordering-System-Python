			<b>Where is my order?</b><br>
			<br>After you place your order, we send it directly to the restaurant, which starts<br> preparing it immediately.<br><br>

			Our restaurants do everything they can to get your food delivered as quickly as<br> possible. However, sometimes restaurants receive very large amount of orders, or<br> drivers get stuck in heavy traffic - this unfortunately might cause delays.<br><br>

			If the amount of time you’ve waited has exceeded the estimated delivery time, you<br> can contact us and we’ll look into what’s going on.<br><br>
			
			<b>How to order online at GoFoody?</b><br><br>
			
			It is really easy, as easy as 1, 2, 3:<br><br>

			1. Tell us where you are: Enter your location so that we can show you which<br> restaurants deliver to you.<br>
			2. Choose what you would like: Pick a restaurant and select items you’d like to order.<br> You can search by restaurant name, cuisine type, dish name or by keyword.<br>
			3. Checkout: Enter your exact delivery address, payment method and your phone<br> number. Always make sure that you enter the correct phone number to help us<br> contact you regarding your order, if needed.<br><br>

			Now sit back, relax, and we’ll get your food delivered to your doorstep.<br><br>
			
			<b>How long does it take for my order to get delivered?</b><br><br>
			
			Delivery time varies from restaurant to restaurant. It also depends on the number of<br> orders that the restaurant has to prepare and on the distance between the restaurant<br> and your delivery address.<br><br>
			
			<b>How can I pay for my order?</b><br><br>
			
			All our restaurants accept cash on delivery. In addition, there are various online<br> payment methods available. You can check which payment methods are accepted at<br> each restaurant by going to the ‘Info’ tab on the restaurant’s page.<br><br>

			<b>Cash on Delivery</b><br>

			Select ‘Cash on Delivery’ on the checkout page and pay the driver at your doorstep<br> when you receive your order.<br><br>

			<b>Credit Card</b><br>

			Select ‘Credit Card’ on the checkout page. After placing your order you will be<br> redirected to the secure payment page of our payment partner, where you can follow<br> the instructions. Once the payment is confirmed, the<br> order will be transmitted to the restaurant.<br>
